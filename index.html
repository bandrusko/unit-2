LEARNING NOTE ABOUT FAVICON ERRORS:

The 404 error for favicon.ico happens because:
1. Browsers automatically look for a file called "favicon.ico" in the root directory
2. Even if you don't specify a favicon, browsers will still try to load it
3. When the file doesn't exist, you get a 404 (Not Found) error

Why fix favicon errors?
- Clean browser console (no error messages)
- Professional appearance with a tab icon
- Better user experience and website recognition
- Prevents unnecessary server requests for missing files

    FAVICON EXPLANATION FOR STUDENTS:
    A favicon is a small icon that appears in the browser tab next to your page title.
    It helps users identify your website when they have multiple tabs open.
    
    Best practices for favicons:
    1. Always include a favicon to avoid 404 errors in the browser console
    2. Use multiple formats for better browser compatibility
    3. Place the favicon.ico file in your root directory for automatic detection
    4. Use descriptive alt text for accessibility
    -->
    
    <!-- Standard favicon (automatically detected by browsers) -->
    <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
    
    <!-- Alternative PNG favicon for better quality (modern browsers prefer this) -->
    <!-- You can create a PNG version later for better quality -->
    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="favicon.ico">
    
    <!-- For older Internet Explorer browsers -->
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico">

    LEARNING NOTE ABOUT SCRIPT LOADING:
    Notice that we're loading Leaflet.js twice in this file:
    1. From CDN (above) - faster, always up-to-date
    2. From local lib folder (at bottom) - works offline, more control
    
    Best practice: Choose ONE method to avoid conflicts and redundancy
    CDN is recommended for most projects unless you need offline functionality

    LEARNING NOTE ABOUT MAP CONTAINER:
    The div with id='mapid' is where our Leaflet map will be rendered.
    Important points:
    1. MUST have a defined width and height (maps need dimensions)
    2. The ID should be unique (used in JavaScript to target this element)
    3. Inline styles work but external CSS is more maintainable
    -->
    <div id='mapid' style='width: 400px; height: 300px;'></div>
    
    <!-- Panel for additional map controls or information -->
    <div id="panel"></div>
    
    <!-- 
    SCRIPT LOADING ORDER IS IMPORTANT:
    1. Load libraries first (Leaflet)
    2. Load your custom scripts last (main.js)
    This ensures all dependencies are available when your code runs
